I created this design because I like the [Urchin](https://github.com/duckyb/urchin) and wanted to try something with 34 keys.  
**This is a strictly wireless-only design, and is only compatible with ZMK / nice!nano. Only Cherry MX switches + Hotswap are suported!**

> Q: Why is this not just another one?  
*A: Original Urchin is based of choc switch. They are good but I still wanted to try something with MX keycaps. Hence we are here looking at the new keeyboard Ursa.*
